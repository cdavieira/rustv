Focus
* Prepare tests to test out all instructions from the RV32I (running in memory)
* Improve debugger (maybe with dwarf info through gimli or addr2line)
* Support arrays
* Execute functions
* Execute recursion

* Create spec::ImmediateFormat ?
* Fix lb and lbu test
* Things like 'la t1, 100(var1)' are now possible, but there's currently no
  check for if 100 % 4 == 0 (for example). This could mess with the text
  section alignment 


* Set starting code address
* Parse riscv32 elf files, decode instructions and execute them in a Virtual Context
* Fix the binary encoding of some instruction formats
* Create tests to check memory alignment after Parser runs
* Create Loader entity
* Create Executor entity
	* assembly into &[u32]
	* debugger
	* elf parser


Code
* Assess the use of u32, i32, usize, ... throughout the project
	* Watch out for places in the code using 'as' casts
* Write simple field evaluator to handle constant expressions?
* Rewrite parts of the code where 'eprintln' is (poorly) used or isn't adequate
* Make sure the minimal instruction set is fully supported
	* Fix binary encoding of some instructions
* Support running real code in a virtual machine
	* (cpu.rs) Prepare set of 32 registers to be R/W
	* (memory.rs) R/W of in-memory addresses
	* (stack.rs)
* Write logger
* (isa.rs) ?
* (execcontext.rs) ?
* (machine.rs) ?
* Move DataEndianness to ???
* pub(crate), pub(self), pub(in path) instead of raw pub
* The 'imm_*' family of functions cant use utils::rsh_mask_bits because they
  operate i32 instead of u32...



Design/Improvements
* Use &str instead of String for the Tokenizer
* Review lexer/tokenizer names
	* Lexer isnt really a lexer, more like a categorizer/classifier/parser
* Review how args (for instructions) are being handled
	* This is a vector of 0-3 elements
	* The instruction requires a syntax and args, which are then parsed by the function 'get_args'
* Improve how 'parser::group_tokens' is implemented
* Review using 'Rc' in order to reduce the number of duplicates for instances of 'dyn Extension'



Test
* Add second extension
	* Check how hard it is to add a new extension
