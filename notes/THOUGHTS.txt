ON WHAT WOULD LATER BECOME THE 'EXTENSION' TRAIT
the tokenizer turns a buffer into a stream of grouped caracteres (or a word for
short), which have no indication of which line/column they occurred

since the lexer has no positional information of each word, it has to somehow
'know' what each caracter is in order to make a token out of it

this design inherently forces the lexer to 'know' what each word is. My attempt
to create a Classifier trait is one way of creating common grounds for doing just that. But this creates a problem
when it comes down to extending the support of the lexer for different opcodes.

You see, the code required for the lexer becomes proportional with the number
of words which have to be mapped to a token.

This creates the need for rewritting parts of the lexer whenever new extensions
of the riscv specification are added/deprecated/changed

Not only that, but later on we also have to somehow spot/tag important tokens among
those the lexer has generated. This is not that hard, since those tokens will
be enums, whose important variants can be pattern matched

At some point, these opcodes will have to somehow provide what they are actually
intended for (summing, subtracting, reading from, writing to) and how they
should be used (1 parameter, no params, two parameters, ...)

if we interpret that an extension is a vector/collection of opcodes, we could
create a trait which would force implementors to define methods to map a string
slice to an opcode. But then, all implementations of Lexers would have to
implement those interfaces/traits in order to bring bridge the lexical space of
the language to the functionality expected for each opcode

we could create something which is independent from the actual string
representing that opcode. Then the implementors job would only be to map the
string slice to the entity for that extension.

ON HOW TO TRANSLATE PSEUDO INSTRUCTIONS
The toplevel trait to be implemented by all lexers states that the return value
for the 'parse' method should be a Vec<Self::Token>.The next step after
classifying the tokens is to group them into instructions to be later executed.
This includes opcodes+arguments, pseudoinst+arguments, label-to-offset
translation, and more. The way this was thought to be done was to turn the
Vec<Self::Token> into a Vec<Vec<Self::Token>>, that is, each element is a
vector of tokens/a instruction.

The only problem arises when doing something with those instructions, more
specifically with the translation of the pseudo instruction into their real
opcodes. The reason for that is because we have to somehow have the ability of
copying multiple times the arguments of pseudo instruction . This is because
pseudo instruction might reuse more than once one of its arguments during the
decode. Well, in rust we can only copy data for types which implement Copy, but
we can't implement the Copy trait for Trait Objects (such as the 'dyn
Extension'), because those aren't compatible with the Sized Trait (which by
itself is necessary to implement Copy). Okay, that's bad. One workaround for
this is to implement the 'Clone' trait instead of the 'Copy' trait and use the
'clone()' method for copying. That's exactly what we did!

But we could've done it differently tho. You see, we don't need to copy/clone
the 'Self::Token' by itself. If we designed the translation method for
pseucodes to be something as: 'translate(&Vec<Self::Token>) -> Vec<(Box<dyn
Extension>, Vec<Arg>)', we wouldn't need to copy the tokens, but still thats
kind of problematic, because this would require turning tokens into such tuples
in at least two different places in the code.
